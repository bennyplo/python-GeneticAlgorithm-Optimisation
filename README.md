# python-GeneticAlgorithm-Optimisation
Python - Genetic Algorithm as an optimisation function (search for global minimum)
developed on Jupyter Notebook

This is a simple example on using genetic algorithm as an optimisation function.
In the program, it basically uses the genetic algorithm to search for the global minimums of varies example functions
